Data programming through labeling functions generating training sets from data


Basic MAchine Learning Models:

1) Linear (linear regression and SVM)   (if data is linearly separated)

2) Tree based  (Decision tree and random forest, cat boost, gradient boosting--very powerful----predictions of the individual trees are summed)  (Linear relationship is hard to capture)  (Divide and conquer approach can wrk with non-linear data as well)

3) KNN (need feature scaling as distance calculated)(---idea behind it closer objects have same labels)

4) Neural networks




**use Label encoder(numeric encoding)  with tree based models as if(male==1) not matters but not with regression as weitage increses one hot-encoding is best with non tree based models
